This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in Rust involving unsafe code and vectors.  The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to modify a vector's contents using a raw pointer. This approach is problematic because it bypasses Rust's memory safety mechanisms, potentially leading to undefined behavior and crashes. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a safe and correct alternative that avoids the use of raw pointers and maintains memory safety.
